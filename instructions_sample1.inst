#Instruction File Sample
#
#Note that many of the pipeline related configuration options can specified on
#stage-by-stage basis as well. The local (stage) option will have precedence
#over the global options. Not including an option in an instructions block
#implicitly result in the default operation for option to be performed. This
#applies for the VEGAS cuts and configuration options as well. Be careful, as
#the default operations/values may differ from what is desirable.
#
#Analysis/Configuration Keys and pipeline-specific options are case sensitive at the moment. 
#Configuration/Cuts options must be specfied using convention expected by VEGAS  
#Leading and trailing whitespace will stripped before parsing, and identation is not
#required.

#These are the global configuration options for the script
